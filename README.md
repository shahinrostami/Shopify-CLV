========================= <br>
Revenue growth is great in a young business, but to sustain that growth, the business must retain customers as repeat buyers. Acquiring new customers requires significantly more money in marketing than to just retain the existing customers. A valuable company will be able to retain customers that try their products and therefore sustain their revenue growth. We model a small online business that sells through Shopify. We focus on characteristics from a customerâ€™s first purchase that could indicate their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and we model that CLV from the features obtained in the first purchase.
